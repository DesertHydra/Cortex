# Localizations

The `en_us.json` file is not here! It is on [`src/generated/assets/cortex/lang/en_us.json`](../../../../generated/assets/cortex/lang/en_us.json), since that file is automatically generated by code.

Feel free to use it as the base of your localization! Just remember to put it in the same folder as the `pt_br.json` file.
